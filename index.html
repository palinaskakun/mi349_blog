    <p>Jazz dance started from African-American dances in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It became hugely popular during the Roaring Twenties. This dance is all about freedom, creativity, and style. It's a dance that lets you express yourself, and it's always evolving.

      What makes jazz dance unique is its versatility. Depending on the music, it can be slow and sultry or fast and energetic. There are many famous jazz moves like the "jazz hands", "kick ball change", and others. These moves not only show off a dancer's skill but also their emotion. When someone dances jazz, they put their heart and soul into every step.
      
      Today, jazz dance keeps adapting. As new music genres emerge, jazz dance changes to fit them. This dance style borrows from cultures around the world, making it a global phenomenon. Whether you're at a jazz club, dancing to a live band, or watching a theatrical performance, jazz dance leaves an impression. Everywhere you look, from TV shows to movies to stage performances, you'll find traces of jazz dance. Its rich history promises an even richer future, with new moves, music, and styles waiting to be explored.

  <p>Ballet is a beautiful and classic dance form that started in Italy and became famous in France and Russia. It's known for its grace, precision, and storytelling.

    Dancers in ballet wear special shoes called "pointe shoes" that let them dance on the tips of their toes. This gives them a floating or flying look. Ballet moves are very technical, and dancers spend years practicing to get them right.
    
    One of the best things about ballet is its stories. Many ballets tell fairy tales or romantic stories. Popular ballets like "Swan Lake" and "The Nutcracker" have music and dances that people recognize even if they haven't seen the whole show.
    
    Ballet is not just about the dance; it's about the music, costumes, and sets too. Everything comes together to create magic on stage.
    
    Today, while keeping its traditions, ballet also evolves. Some choreographers are mixing ballet with other dance styles, giving it a modern twist. This shows that ballet is both timeless and ever-changing.
    
    From big stages in cities to small schools in towns, ballet is everywhere. It touches hearts with its beauty and continues to inspire many to dance.
